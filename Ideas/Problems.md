## Noise

Multiple People Holistics Shifting due to multiple people in frame.

## Training

Time consuming

Data has to be very precise

While training, transition from one action to another is very ill spaced 

We can use a GAN model, to generate more such training data at the cost of poor training data

## DATA PROCESSING

 We have to use HSV colourspace and background elimination
